# Automata
A very simple cross-platform real-time strategy game where the player must out-program the other to win.

  The game is intended to showcase a fair sized economic system, with product stocks and fluctuating prices.
Technology progresses as in-game companies generate revenue to research and develop new hardware and stock 
software. Players and AI alike are thus able to generate funds via investments, as well as the buy and sell
of products between eachother.

  Hardware purchased allows for the construction of specialized bots used for competitions. These range from
combat to puzzles as the machines autonomously compete with eachother. However, while the hardware of the
machines may be built-in to the game (unless I can find a decent way to allow customized hardware, but
that'll be far off if ever), the robots will be run via scripts the user programs into them. Different hardware
will extend the core API of the base language (Probably based off of KNX, another project of mine, or lua or python).

  Note, this is primarily an exercise in conventional and neural artificial intelligence for real-time interaction
and for simple economic models. Admittedly idealistic, it seems like a fun pet-project.
